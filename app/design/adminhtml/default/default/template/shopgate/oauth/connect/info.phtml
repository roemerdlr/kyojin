<h3>Please define a store view</h3>
<p>When you are about to connect your shop with shopgate, you have to define a store view as a default store. This has to be done to have a solid and unique reference for shopgate internal tasks like adding mobile orders to your shopsystem or export the storeview dependent prices of your catalog for mobile devices.</p>
<p>You can adjust the reference later on in the module configuration.</p>
